# USB-Capture-Card-Reversing

Making attempts at documenting and reversing cheap chinese USB HDMI capture cards with EEPROM dumps and firmware extraction. 

First dumps uploaded from "USB3.0 Video Capture HDMI 4K" that enumerate as eEver USB Video device, with "No signal V1.8" shown if no video input. However my units do not enable on USB 3.0 even though they have the correct pins connected and all traces connected.
